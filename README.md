# Logs
This repository contains simple logging APIs for various programming languages.  They are useful for debugging and displaying messages.  Debuggers and IDEs can be great, but the simple `print` statement will never fail you.

This code is completely free.  Please don't hesitate to use it in your own programming projects.  I hope that it will help you debug your code and make something amazing.  It certainly has helped me.
